# ðŸ”– Community Archive

Deployed at: https://www.community-archive.org/

> We believe there is immense value in preserving the history of subcultures on twitter. While Twitter charges exorbitantly for convenient access to our own data, we are getting people to request and download their data, and upload it to a common archive!

_from Xiq's [Towards data sovereignty, and a backup of the twitter canon](https://xiqo.substack.com/p/upload-to-the-community-archive)_.

The goals of this project are (1) create a public domain dataset so that we can analyze & build apps on top of our own data, commercial or otherwise (2) develop an open workflow for archival that people can self host or create private archives for their communities if they wish.
