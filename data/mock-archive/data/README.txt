The easiest way to navigate your archive is to open the HTML renderer in a desktop web browser by double clicking the “Your archive” file included in the main folder once the archive is unzipped.

Note that the HTML renderer only works if the archive is less than 50GB. Also note that the HTML renderer only includes a subset of the data included in the archive. To see all the data included in the archive, please navigate the JSON files located in the “data” folder.

The data folder consists of machine-readable JSON files with a .js extension containing information associated with this account. We’ve included the information we believe is most relevant and useful, including profile information, Tweets, Direct Messages, Moments, images, videos and GIFs attached to Tweets, Direct Messages or Moments, followers, following, address book, Lists created, a member of, or subscribed to, interest and demographic information that we have inferred, information about ads seen or engaged with on Twitter, and more.

Each file contains detailed information about that category of data. To see this information, simply double click on one of the JSON files. Note that some information, such as the media shared via Direct Messages, is included in a folder instead of a JSON file. Separately, also note that some files may not contain any information if your account is not associated with any of the data they cover.

The information contained in this archive reflects the state of the account at the time when the archive was created.
