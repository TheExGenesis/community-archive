Dear uploader,
 
I’m writing to let you know of a privacy incident in the Twitter Community Archive.
 
"Twitter Circles" is a cancelled twitter feature (Aug 2022 to Nov 2023) that let you post tweets privately to an inner circle of your choice.
 
In the exported archives, these tweets are indistinguishable from public tweets. This means that if you uploaded your archive, circle tweets have been public.
 
To avoid circle tweets from leaking, we have
Temporarily stopped serving tweets from that period, and
Stopped serving the archive .json files.
This might hurt some apps running on the archive.
 
If you want to make absolutely sure, you can delete your archive (or let us know and we'll delete it):
 
1. Go to https://www.community-archive.org/
2. Once logged in, click on "Upload a new archive, or delete your data"
3. Click "Delete my Archive"
 
Note that the Community Archive's dataset is publicly available, so anyone who may have downloaded the full data in the past will still have these tweets on their hard drive.
 
We found about this vulnerability last month and have been working to identify all the circle tweets so we can delete them. We didn’t disclose right away to avoid people who might have downloaded in the past from knowing they were holding circle tweets. However, this job has been taking longer than we expected, so we’re taking the conservative measures above until we finish. In retrospect, I think we should’ve taken the conservative measures right away.
 
Thank you to @__justplaying for notifying us of the this.
 
This sucks and I’m really sorry it happened.
 
Let us know if you have any questions
